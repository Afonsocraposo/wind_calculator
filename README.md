# wind_calculator

This application can be used by pilots to aid while flying without GPS. The application calculates the wind's direction and speed using your smartphone's GPS, Compass and the approximated value of True Air Speed (provided by you).

## How to:
The application is very simple to use; you only have to provide the approximated value of TAS in knots by clicking on the displayed value and the app will calculate and display the rest.
You can also provided a fixed Heading by clicking on the displayed value.
All the values are in degrees magnetic and you can change the Magnetic Variation in the Settings, accessible by the button on the top right corner.

### DISCLAIMER:
This application is not certified. Its own purpose is trying to help while flying. Don't take these values as absolute. I'm not responsible for anything and if you install the application you agree with everything said.
